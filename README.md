# Crop-Recommendation-and-Crop-Yield-Prediction-System

This repository contains a machine learning system for accurately predicting crop yields and recommending the best crops based on environmental factors and historical data. The goal is to enhance agricultural productivity, resource management, and sustainability, while ensuring food security.

Introduction
The Crop Recommendation and Crop Yield Prediction System aims to address the following objectives: 

- Accurately forecast crop yields in a given area.
- Inform decision-making for farmers and policymakers regarding planting, harvesting, and distribution.
- Provide personalized guidance to farmers regarding crop selection and management.
- Improve crop yields, reduce waste, and increase profitability for farmers.
- Improve agricultural productivity, optimize resource management, and adapt to changing environmental conditions.
- Increase market competitiveness and food security.
- Promote sustainable agriculture and preserve natural resources.


Proposed System


The system follows a structured workflow:

- Model Building: Develop machine learning models using regression and classification algorithms, such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and Logistic Regression.

- Front-end Development: Create an intuitive and user-friendly web application to interact with the system. Implement features like input fields for environmental factors and historical data, and display predicted crop yields and recommended crops.

- Backend Development and Connectivity: Establish connectivity between the frontend and backend of the system. Utilize Flask, a Python framework, to handle backend operations and integrate the trained models.



Experimentation and Result Analysis

The system incorporates the following steps:

- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather relevant datasets and preprocess them by removing null values and converting categorical variables into numerical values using techniques like label encoding and one-hot encoding.

- Model Selection: Select the best-performing models for crop recommendation and crop yield prediction using k-fold cross-validation. Evaluate the models using metrics like cross-validation scores.

- Model Training and Evaluation: Train the selected models using appropriate datasets and evaluate their performance using evaluation metrics such as R2 score for regression and classification reports and confusion matrices for classification.

- Model Deployment: Save the trained models and integrate them into the web application. Utilize pickle files to load the models during runtime.


Conclusion

The Crop Recommendation and Crop Yield Prediction System provides farmers with valuable insights and recommendations to enhance their crop production efforts. By accurately predicting crop yields and recommending suitable crops based on environmental factors, the system aims to improve agricultural productivity, reduce risk, and promote sustainable farming practices.

Please refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on setting up and deploying the system. Contributions and feedback are welcome to further improve the system's capabilities and impact in the field of agriculture.

Let's revolutionize crop yield prediction and crop recommendation to drive sustainable and efficient food production.
